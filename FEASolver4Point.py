'''
Solves the equation \nabla u=f(x,y) using the Finite Element method. 

This Finite Element code uses symbollic math instead of numeric math by implementing
the sympy library. 

This Code solves for the functional of the equation then establishes 
boundary conditions and solves.

Most of the concepts for this code were taken from The Finite Element for Scientists
and Engineers, ISBN 0-471-37078-9.  As such, I have enumerated the steps of the finite element
method as labeled in that book, within the comments of the program. Unlike the book, however, this 
example is in two dimensions instead of just one. The functional for a two-dimensional
differential equation problem was taken from Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and 
Engineers, ISBN 0-486-67620-X.
